    "However, instead of taking the PGF for time $t$, $\\Phi(x,t)$ and stepping forward an amount $\\Delta t$ using $\\hat{\\mu}(x)$ as we did in deriving the Forward Kolmogorov Equations, we take the PGF for time $\\Delta t$ from {prf:ref}`lem-PGFatDt` and step forward an amount $t$ using $\\Phi(x,t)$.  This will arrive at a different partial differential equation for $\\Phi(x,t)$.  However, both equations will yield the same solution $\\Phi(x,t)$.  Each equation gives insight into different properties of $\\Phi(x,t)$.\n",
