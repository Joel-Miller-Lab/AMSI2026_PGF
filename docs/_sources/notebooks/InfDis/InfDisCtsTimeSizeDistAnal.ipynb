The solution does not tell us about how past sizes and current sizes are correlated, and so it does not directly give us the total size distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead we will use a different approach.  We first make some observations about the trees that emerge from this continuous-time Galton-Watson process.

Each node persists for an exponentially distributed random time with rate $\\beta+\\gamma$.  At that point she is replaced by either $k=0$ (crosses) or $k=2$ nodes with identical properties. The corresponding probabilities are $p_0=\\gamma/(\\beta+\\gamma)$ and $p_2=\\beta/(\\beta+\\gamma)$.  In the disease conceptualization, the $k=0$ case corresponds to recovery.  The $k=2$ case corresponds to the infected individual infecting another individual, with the same individual represented by  different nodes before and after the event (we can think of the original infected individual being the left offspring and the newly infected individual being the right offspring).  Although this plot shows $9$ nodes, it corresponds to exactly $5$ total individuals.\n",
