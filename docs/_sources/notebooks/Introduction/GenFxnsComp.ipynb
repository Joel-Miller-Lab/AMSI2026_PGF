    "# Composition of PGFs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we focus just on PGFs.  Given two PGFs, we would like to know how to interpret $\\mu_1(\\mu_2(x))$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We have learned the following facts for PGFs:\n",
    "- If we take a linear combination of PGFs $\\mu_1(x)$, $\\mu_2(x)$, $\\ldots$ where the coefficients themselves are probabilities summing to $1$:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\\psi(x) = \\sum \\pi_i \\mu_i(x)$$\n",
    "  then $\\psi(x)$ is a PGF and the corresponding distribution can be thought of as choosing the distribution for $\\mu_i$ with probability $\\pi_i$ and then choosing $n$ from that distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we multiply PGFs $\\mu_1(x)$, $\\mu_2(x)$, $\\ldots$, $\\mu_k(x)$ together:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\\psi(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^k \\mu_i(x)$$\n",
    "  then $\\psi(x)$ is a PGF and the corresponding distribution can be thought of as choosing one number from each of the $k$ distributions for $\\mu_1(x), \\ldots, \\mu_k(x)$ and then adding the $k$ numbers together."
