    "This will be **due Friday 23 Jan, 11:59PM**.  I'll set up a submission portal on Moodle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please do not use AI to assist with these.  I plan to do some \"auditing\" of solutions to make sure you can reproduce the answers you submit.  I will update these instructions with guidance about a prompt that you can use with AI systems to get help on these.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get help or give help to anyone else, please find a similar problem to discuss.  Do not directly work on a problem in the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "These problems are **not** ordered by difficulty.  They are ordered roughly with where the corresponding material appears in the text.  I have a reputation for setting long assignments (I get excited by what each problem can reveal to students).  I will have consultation hours next week (and I will make sure that you can reach me on zoom if you are remote).  As I see where people struggle, I may add hints to these questions.\n",

    "2. Suppose a generating function is defined as  \n",

    "   $$\n",
    "   f(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} c_n x^n,\n",

    "   1. According to the generating-function paradigm, what sequence $(c_n)$ does the function $f(x)$ represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Explain how the generating-function paradigm interprets $f(x)$ as a compact way of encoding this sequence. In your explanation, describe how the coefficients $c_n$ can be recovered from the function using derivatives evaluated at $x = 0$.\n",

    "3. Let $X$ be a discrete random variable with values $\\{0,1,2,\\ldots\\}$ and \n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   P(X = k) = C \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k \\quad \\text{for } k = 0,1,2,\\ldots\n",

    "   1. Determine the value of $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Find the probability generating function $\\mu(x)$ in closed form.\n",

    "   3. Use $\\mu(x)$ and $x \\partial_x$ to find $\\sum_k k^2/2^k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In high school I came across a method that seemed to find all of the numbers that are both triangular numbers $(m)(m+1)/2$ and square numbers $n^2$ (I couldn't prove it at the time).  \n",
    "\n",
    "   Consider the sequence $a_n$ defined by $a_0=1$, $a_1=2$ and $a_{n+2} = a_n + 2a_{n+1}$ and the sequence $b_n$ defined by $b_0=1$, $b_1 = 3$ and $b_{n+2} = b_n + 2b_{n+1}$.  Then $(a_nb_n)^2$ is both triangular and square.\n",
    "\n",
    "   I've since learned that this property of the sequence is known, but it's still an interesting result.  We can use OGFs to prove that these are both triangular and square (though it doesn't prove that every triangular and square number is in the sequence).  Some of these steps follow our derivation of the formula for the Fibonacci numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   1. For $n=0, 1, 2$ use direct calculate to verify $b_n^2 + (-1)^n = 2a_n^2$.  Thus it follows that $(a_nb_n)^2 = b_n^2(b_n^2\\pm 1)/2$ is both square and triangular.  Now we want to show this for the general case, and be able to quickly find the $n$-th such number.\n",
    "   2. Derive the OGFs $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ for both $a_n$ and $b_n$.  \n",
    "   3. Let $Q= 1+\\sqrt{2}$ and $R = 1-\\sqrt{2}$.  Your denominators for the OGFs should equal $(1-Qx)(1-Rx)$.  Write $f(x) = A/(1-Qx) + B/(1-Rx)$.  Find $A$ and $B$.\n",
    "   4. Use this to write $a_n$ in terms of $Q$ and $R$. Similar steps show that $b_n = (Q^{n+1} + R^{n+1})/2$.\n",
    "   5. Write $b_n^2$ in terms of $Q$ and $R$, simplifying any $QR$ term using $QR=-1$.\n",
    "   6. Similarly simplify $2a_n^2$ in terms of $Q$ and $R$, and show that $2a_n^2  = b_n^2 + (-1)^n$.  \n",
    "   7. Thus explain why $b_n^2 a_n^2$ is a triangular number (it is clearly square).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. \n",
    "   1. Show how the variance of a distribution can be written using derivatives of a PGF evaluated at $1$.\n",
    "   2. Show that the variance equals the mean, iff $\\mu''(1)/\\mu'(1) = \\mu'(1)$.  \n",
    "   3. Use PGFs to show that the variance of the Poisson distribution equals its mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Suppose \n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   f(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty f_n x^n\n",
    "   \\quad\\text{and}\\quad\n",
    "   g(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty g_n x^n\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   are ordinary generating functions for sequences $(f_n)$ and $(g_n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. If $\\alpha,\\beta\\in\\mathbb{R}$, write down the generating function corresponding to the sequence $(\\alpha f_n+\\beta g_n)_{n\\ge 0}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Explain why this shows that the set of all generating functions is closed under linear combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Consider a pair of standard tetrahedral (4-sided) dice numbered $1, 2, 3, 4$.\n",
    "   1. Find the PGF of the sum found by rolling both.\n",
    "   2. Find another pair of 4-sided dice that have positive integer values and give the same sums with the same probabilities.\n",
    "   3. Show that the only possible pairs are the standard dice and the pair you have just found.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. A researcher is looking for patients with a particular rare disease.  Based on careful experiments and knowledge of exposure risk in the populations, she expects the PGF for the number of patients in several similarly sized populations should be $\\mu(x) = e^{5(x-1)}$.  However, when she looks at medical records, she sees that the number seems to have PGF $e^{1.5(x-1)}$.  Using the fact that $\\mu(0.7+0.3x) = e^{1.5(x-1)}$ and many individuals in the population have limited access to medical care, explain what may have happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Consider a Galton–Watson process with $X_0=1$ and offspring distribution given by $\\Pr(k=3)=1$ (every individual has exactly 3 offspring).\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Draw the Galton–Watson tree up to (and including) generation $2$.\n",
    "   2. What are the values of $X_0$, $X_1$, and $X_2$?\n",
    "   3. Give a formula for $X_g$ for general $g \\geq 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Consider a Galton-Watson process with offspring distribution having PGF $\\mu(x)$.\n",
    "   1. Explain why the extinction probability $\\alpha$ of a Galton-Watson process must equal $\\mu(\\alpha)$.  \n",
    "   2. We always have $1 = \\mu(1)$.  Why does this not guarantee us that all Galton-Watson processes go extinct?\n",
    "   3. Assume that $3$ individuals of a  plant species are introduced into 3 locations in Victoria.  Find the extinction probability in terms of $\\alpha$ calculated for a single introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Consider a Galton-Watson process with offspring distibution having PGF $\\mu_r(x) = (r + (2-r)x^2)/2$ for $r=1$ or $r=5/4$ and $r=3/2$.\n",
    "   1. Show that for all of these values it goes extinct with probability $1$. \n",
    "   2. Plot $1-\\alpha_g$ for $g = 1, \\ldots, 100$ for these values of $r$ with a logarithmic vertical scale.\n",
    "   3. Plot the expected size at generation $g$ for these same values. \n",
    "   4. Plot the expected size conditional on not being extinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. I plan to add a problem on size distributions for different generations.  "
