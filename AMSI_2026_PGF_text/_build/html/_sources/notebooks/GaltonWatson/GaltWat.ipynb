    "# The Galton-Watson Process\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "One of the first applications of Probability Generating Functions in biological contexts was by Galton and Watson in the mid 1860s and 1870s.  They were concerned about the extinction of aristrocratic family names in England, where the names were passed down from father to sons.  Others independently introduced the Galton-Watson process both before and after Galton and Watson.\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate the probability a name goes extinct, we start by analyzing one male individual and consider sons he might have. Assume that each male has $k$ male offspring with probability $p_k$ and they all inherit the family name.  We call the distribution of the number of male offspring the offspring distribution. We assume that the offspring distribution remains the same from generation to generation.\n",

    "Consider a distribution of non-negative integers where $p_k$ is the probability of $k$, which we call the *offspring distribution*.  A **Galton Watson process** is a sequence of random numbers $\\{X_g\\}_{g \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ such that $X_0=1$ and $X_{g+1} = \\sum_{j=1}^{X_g} k_{g,j}$ where each $k_{g,j}$ is chosen independently from the offspring distribution.  The numbers are indexed by **generation** $g$.\n",

    "### Galton-Watson Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, we often think of a Galton-Watson process as consisting of individuals who are alive for one generation and at the end of generation $g$, the $j$th individual of that generation is replaced by their offspring: $k_{g,j}$ new individuals where $k_{g,j}$ is chosen from the offspring distribution.  The \"parent-child\" relationship leads naturally to a directed tree whose root is the initial individual.\n",

    "This leads to an equivalent description of a Galton-Watson process through a directed tree, which we call a Galton-Watson tree.  Often it will be easier to prove things about the set of Galton-Watson trees rather than the sequence of numbers $\\{X_g\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree shown in {numref}`fig-ExampleGaltWat` is an example of a Galton-Watson tree.  Now we give a formal definition of how to create one, starting from the top node and building each level by choosing the number of \"offspring\" of each node from the offspring distribution.  We choose to index the nodes  $u_{g+1,j}$ in level $g+1$ so that their order follows the ordering of their \"parents\". \n",
