    "# The Galton-Watson Process\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first applications of Probability Generating Functions in biological contexts was by Galton and Watson in the mid 1860s and 1870s.  They were concerned about the extinction of aristrocratic family names in England, where the names were passed down from father to sons.  Others independently introduced the Galton-Watson process both before and after Galton and Watson.\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate the probability a name goes extinct, we start by analyzing one male individual and consider sons he might have. Assume that each male has $k$ male offspring with probability $p_k$ and they all inherit the family name.  We call the distribution of the number of male offspring the offspring distribution. We assume that the offspring distribution remains the same from generation to generation.\n",

    "Consider a distribution of non-negative integers where $p_k$ is the probability of $k$, which we call the *offspring distribution*.  A **Galton Watson process** is a sequence of random numbers $\\{X_g\\}_{g \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ such that $X_0=1$ and $X_{g+1} = \\sum_{j=1}^{X_g} k_{j,g}$ where each $k_{j,g}$ is chosen independently from the offspring distribution.  The numbers are indexed by **generation** $g$.\n",

    "## Applications of the Galton-Watson Process\n",
    "Although the focus on family names is perhaps frivolous, there are many other important scenarios that are mathematically equivalent.  For example:\n",
    "- An invasive species has arrived at a location.  Each female produces $k$ female offspring with probability $p_k$.\n",
    "- A virus has just entered a person's body and begins to infect cells.  Each virus produces $k$ new viruses with probability $p_k$.\n",
    "- An infected individual has just entered a large population.  Each infected individual creates $k$ new infections with probability $p_k$.\n",
    "- A cell has just mutated to become cancerous.  Each cancerous cell produces $k$ new cells with probability $p_k$ (in this case the cell either dies $k=0$ or divides $k=2$).\n",
    "- A new mutated gene appears in a single individual which may have beneficial or harmful effects.  These are passed down to its offspring.\n",
    "- A gambler buys a \\$1 lottery ticket.  The ticket pays \\$k with probability $p_k$.  The gambler spends all proceeds on new tickets (with the same probabilities $p_k$).\n",
