    "# Extinction probability over time\n",
    "\n",
    "In {numref}`sec:GaltWatExtinct`, we showed that the probability $\\alpha$ of extinction of a Galton-Watson Process is a solution to the equation $x = \\mu(x)$.  However, we saw that sometimes there are two solutions in $[0,1]$, so identifying which is the correct solution may not be obvious.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the correct solution, we calculate $\\alpha_g$, the probability that it is extinct by generation $g$.  We assume one inividual exists in generation $g=0$, and thus $\\alpha_0=0$.  In order for it to go extinct by generation $g=1$, the initial infected individual must infect no-one, so $\\alpha_1 = p_0 = \\mu(0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $g>1$, we follow a very similar argument to our initial argument that showed $\\alpha = \\mu(\\alpha)$.  The probability that the process goes extinct by generation $g$ is equal to the probability that all direct offspring of the initial individual spark their own Galton-Watson Process that is extinct within $g-1$ generations.\n",
