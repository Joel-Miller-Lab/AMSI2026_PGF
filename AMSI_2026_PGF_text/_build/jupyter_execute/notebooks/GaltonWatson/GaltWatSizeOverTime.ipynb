    "The major result we rely on in thiss section is that if $\\mu_1(x)$ and $\\mu_2(x)$ are both PGFs, then $\\psi(x) = \\mu_1(\\mu_2(x))$ is the PGF for the following process:\n",
    "First we choose $k$ from the distribution of $\\mu_1$.  Then we choose $k$ numbers from the distribution of $\\mu_2$ and add them together.\n",

    "If $\\mu(x)$ is the PGF of the offspring distribution of a Galton-Watson process, then the distribution of sizes at generation $g$ has PGF $\\mu^{(g)}(x)$ where $\\mu^{(0)}(x) = x$ and $\\mu^{(g)}(x) = \\mu^{(g-1)}(\\mu(x)) = \\mu(\\mu^{(g-1)}(x))$.\n",

    "We will give two proofs of this theorem.  At first glance the difference between the two proofs appears trivial.  However, later when we will look at continuous-time variations of the Galton-Watson process the two methods will lead to very different equations.\n",

    "We use induction on the generation $g$.  At the base case, $g=0$, we know that $X_0=1$, so $\\mu^{(0)}(x)=x$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the inductive step, we know that the distribution of $X_{g-1}$ is $\\mu^{(g-1)}(x)$.  By the definition of the Galton-Watson process, $X_g$ is found by choosing $X_{g-1}$ numbers from the offspring distribution and adding them together.  So the PGF of the distribution of $X_g$ is $\\mu^{(g-1)}(\\mu(x))$.\n",

We know that chain of descendents from each individual in generation $1$ can be thought of as the start of its own Galton-Watson process, and the number of individuals at generation $g-1$ from each of the generation $1$ individuals is $\\mu^{(g-1)}(x)$.\n",

    "Since the number of individuals at generation $1$ has PGF $\\mu(x)$ and the number of descendents after $g-1$ from each of these has PGF $\\mu^{(g-1)}(x)$, we conclude that the size distribution at generation $g$ has PGF $\\mu^{(g)}(x)$.\n",
