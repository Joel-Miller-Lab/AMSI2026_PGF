    "Often for infectious diseases we are interested in the total number of infections that occur in an outbreak.  We will prove a theorem about the probability that an SIR outbreak spreading in a very large population fails to start an epidemic and instead goes extinct with exactly $j$ total infections.  The result is more general and applies to any Galton-Watson process, but infectious diseases are typically where we are most interested in knowng the total size of small outbreaks.\n",

Thus the probability that a Galton-Watson tree has $j$ nodes is equal to the combined probabilities of all length-$j$ sequences $k_1, \\ldots, k_j$ that correspond to $j$-node Galton-Watson trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the proof, we \"just\" need to characterize all of the allowable sequences and calculate their combined probability.  To characterize them, we need to identify relevant constraints on the sequences, as not all length-$j$ sequences correspond to $j$-node trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "One constraint is that if the Galton-Watson tree has exactly $j$ nodes, then $j-1$ of them have exactly one parent and the other has no parent.  So a Galton-Watson tree having exactly $j$ nodes would require that the sum of the number of offspring of all $j$ nodes is $j-1$.  Thus $\\sum_{i=1}^j k_i = j-1$.\n",

So we can see that the probability that a tree would have exactly $j$ nodes would likely be related to $p_{j-1}^{(j)}$.  However, we haven't yet explained where the $1/j$ prefactor comes from.  Indeed, we might (incorrectly, as I initially did) expect the probability a Galton-Watson tree has exactly $j$ nodes should equal $p_{j-1}^{(j)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is still another constraint that we need to handle.  To see it, let us imagine that $j=2$.  If the first node has zero offspring and the second has one offspring, have we created a Galton-Watson tree with exactly $j=2$ nodes?  No. If the first node has no offspring then the tree is already complete -- there is no second node.  On the other hand if the first node has one offspring and the second has none, then we do have a Galton-Watson tree with $2$ nodes. So only half of the length-$2$ sequences of $0$ and $1$ that add up to $1$ correspond to a valid Galton-Watson process.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in addition to requiring that the number of offspring sum to $j-1$, there is a constraint on the order.  Under the formulation so far, that constraint is that no subsequence $(k_1, \\ldots, k_\\ell)$ for $\\ell<j$ sums to $\\ell-1$ as this would mean that the Galton-Watson tree terminates after $\\ell$ nodes.  \n",
