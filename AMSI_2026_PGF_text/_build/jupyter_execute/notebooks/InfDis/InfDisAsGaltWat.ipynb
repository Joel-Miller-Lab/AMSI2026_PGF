    "In the infinite population limit of a well-mixed population, starting from a single infected individual, we can assume that every transmission (at every generation) goes to a previously uninfected recipient.  Thus every transmission causes an infection, regardless of whether it is an SIS or SIR disease.  The SIS and SIR diseases are mathematically indistinguishable in this case, and the number of infections caused by each individual is chosen independently from the offspring distribution.\n",

    "- an infectious disease outbreak begins with a single infected individual (the *index case* ) counted as generation $0$, \n",
    "- the infections are separated by generation so that those infected by generation $g$ are considered to be in generation $g$,\n",
    "- the number of transmissions caused by each infected individual is independent of all others and has PGF $\\mu(x)$.\n",
    "- the population is large enough that every transmission goes to a new never-before infected individual,\n",

    "Then the number of infections at generation $g$ forms a Galton-Watson process with offspring distribution $\\mu(x)$.  If we generate edges from infector to infectee, we get a Galton-Watson tree.\n",
