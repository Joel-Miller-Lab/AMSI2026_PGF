    "Conceptually if all we care about is the counts at time $t$, one individual creating $k-1$ offspring is equivalent to one individual being replaced by $k$ offspring.  This allows us to combine our reproduction and deaths into a single Poisson process with a combined rate $r$.  When the event occurs, the individual is removed and replaced by number of offspring with a given distribution.  We define\n",
