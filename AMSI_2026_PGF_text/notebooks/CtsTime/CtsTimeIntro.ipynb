    "# Continuous-Time Galton-Watson Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've been thinking about Galton-Watson Processes as evolving in generations.  Each \"time-step\" is a new generation.  This leads to a discrete-time setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are many cases where we might want to model a system as evolving in time.  This is particularly true if individuals may have different life-spans, so that generations overlap in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now consider a continuous-time version of the Galton-Watson process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As in our earlier work, we assume the population at time $t$ is made up of individuals and we denote the number by $X(t)$.  The probability that there are $\\ell$ of them at time $t$ is $\\mathbb{P}[X(t)=\\ell] = p_\\ell(t)$.  We will use \n",

    "## Properties of Poisson Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things simple, we will assume that events happen with rates.  This means we are thinking of Poisson processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:definition} Poisson Process, rate of a Poisson Process\n",
    ":label: def-PoissonProcess\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Poisson Process** can be thought of as an event that occurs with some **rate** $r$ such that the probability the event occurs in any time interval $(t, t+\\Delta t)$ is $r \\Delta t + \\mathcal{o}(\\Delta t)$.\n",
    "```\n",
    "The notation $\\mathcal{o}(\\Delta t)$ refers to an error that shrinks much faster than $\\Delta t$:  $\\mathcal{o}(\\Delta t)/\\Delta t \\to 0$ as $\\Delta t \\to 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the definition above, you can reasonably think of $\\mathcal{o}(\\Delta t)$ as being something quadratic in $\\Delta t$.  Even though $r \\Delta t \\to 0$ as $\\Delta t \\to 0$, the error term goes to $0$ much faster, so the leading order term is a reasonable approximation.[^infinitesimal]\n",
    "[^infinitesimal]: This is an aside, which isn't really relevant to this subject but it's a useful way to think about integration in general and the role of that $\\mathcal{o}(\\Delta t)$ term.  In Calculus we often add together a large number of very small things to get something approximate.  As the number of things increases and their sizes decrease, we expect the total sum to converge.  Implicitly this relies on the fact that the sizes of our $N$ objects are each approximately proportional to $1/N$ with an error term that goes to zero faster than $1/N$.  So adding up the $N$ errors will give something that goes to $0$ as $N$ increases.  \n",

    "```{prf:remark} Rates are not probabilities\n",
    ":label: remark-RateNeqProb\n",
    "\n",
    "A common misconception in terminology is to use the word \"probability\" when meaning \"rate\".  They are closely related, but are not the same.  The probability shrinks as $\\Delta t$ shrinks, but the rate remains the same.  They are only (almost) the same if $\\Delta t= 1$ and the rate is very small.  We usually want to know what happens for $\\Delta t \\to 0$.\n",
    "```\n",

    "### The Markovian assumption and some implications\n",
    "We will assume that at time $t$, each individual is indistinguishable from any other.  Specifically, this means that the rate at which something happens to an individual is independent of age, nor does it depend on how long it has been since any other event occurred involving that individual.\n",

    "```{prf:theorem} Competing Poisson Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two Poisson Process, with rates $r_1$ and $r_2$.  Then the next event occurs with combined rate $r_1+r_2$.  It is event $1$ with probability $r_1/(r_1+r_2)$ and event $2$ with probability $r_2/(r_1+r_2)$.  The probability it is both events goes to zero.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the effort to prove this theorem focuses on handling the possibility that both events occur.  In reality if we divide time finely enough, they will not happen at the same time.  The way the proof works is to divide time into small intervals, look at the first interval where something happens and then determine the probability it is one of them, and show that the probability of both is negligibly small.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternate way to think about this is that there is a single labelled molecule in an 1L aquarium.  Two drains are open, one with flow at rate $r_1$ and the other with flow at rate $r_2$, with fresh water added at a constant rate to keep the aquarium at $1L$.  Then what is the probability that it goes through drain $1$ versus drain $2$?  You can see that it should be proportional to the amount flowing through them, that is their rates, and the probabilities need to sum to $1$, so it must be $r_1/(r_1+r_2)$ and $r_2/(r_1+r_2)$.  A more rigorous argument is below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:proof} \n",
    "To prove this rigorously, we divide time into intervals $[t_0,t_1)$, $[t_1,t_2)$, $[t_2, t_3)$, $\\ldots$ where $t_{i+1}-t_i=\\Delta t$, and take $\\Delta t \\to 0$.  Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the rates and $q_1 = r_1\\Delta t + \\mathcal{o}(\\Delta t)$ and $q_2 = r_2\\Delta t + \\mathcal{o}(\\Delta t)$ be the probabilities for each event to occur in a time interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability that only $1$ happens in a given time interval is $q_1(1-q_2)$.  The probability of only $q_2$ is $q_2(1-q_1)$.  The probability of both is $q_1q_2$.  The probability of at least one is $1-(1-q_1)(1-q_2)= q_1 + q_2 - q_1q_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting for $q_1$ and $q_2$, we see that the probability of at least one event is $(r_1+r_2)\\Delta t + \\mathcal{o}(\\Delta t) -r_1r_2\\Delta t^2 = (r_1+r_2) + \\mathcal{o}(\\Delta t)$.  This is the definition of an event having rate $r_1+r_2$.  So we can assume that *an* event happens with rate $r_1+r_2$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider the first time interval in which something happens.  Conditional on an event happening, the probability of only event $1$ is $q_1/(q_1+q_2-q_1q_2)$.  Substituting in terms of $r_1$ and taking $\\Delta t$ to be small:\n",

    "\n",
    "This means that rather than thinking about two competing Poisson Processes each having its own rate, we can think about a single Poisson Process with the combined rates, and that when an event occurs, which process it corresponds to is random, with probabilities equal to the individual rates divided by the combined rate.\n",
