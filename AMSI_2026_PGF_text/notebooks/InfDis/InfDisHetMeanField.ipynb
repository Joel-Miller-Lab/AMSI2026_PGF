So at early times, the probability of being infected is proportional to $k$ and the contribution to new infections is also proportional to $k$.  Thus these individuals play a role in the dynamics that is proportional to $k^2$.  Disregarding the highest degree individuals is only reasonable if $\\sum_{k>K} k^2 p_k$ is very small.  So typically we must choose $K$ to be quite large and in some cases, (*e.g.*, where $p_k$ decays like $1/k^2$) the impact of large values of $k$ is never negligible.\n",
