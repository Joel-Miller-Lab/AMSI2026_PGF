    "There are times when we may want to find coefficients of a generating function, but we do not have an analytic function.  One scenario where this might occur would be where we know $\\mu(x)$ but we want to find the coefficients of $\\Phi_g(x) = \\mu^{(g)}(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The natural first attempt is to simply take the series expansion of $\\mu(x)$, plug it into itself repeatedly while tracking the coefficients.  Using one of the simplest possible examples, if $\\mu(x) = (1+x^2)/2$, then \n",

    "\\Phi_1(x) &= \\mu(x) = \\frac{1+x^2}{2}\\\\\n",

    "\\Phi_3(x) &= \\mu(\\Phi_2(x)) = \\frac{1 + \\frac{25 + 20x^2 + 14x^4 +4x^6 + x^8}{64}}{2} = \\frac{89 + 20x^2 + 14x^4 + 4x^6 + x^8}{128}\\\\\n",

    "Although this approach will work if the $\\mu(x)$ is simple enough, the number of calculations at each level grows quickly (in this case the number of terms $T_g$ at generation $g$ is $2T_{g-1}-1$, so they will approximately double as $g$ grows), and it quickly becomes impractical to follow all of the coefficients, even using computers to do the calculations.\n",
