    "\n",
    "This will be **due Friday 23 Jan, 11:59PM**.  I'll set up a submission portal on Moodle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please do not use AI to assist with these.  I plan to do some \"auditing\" of solutions to make sure you can reproduce the answers you submit.  I will update these instructions with guidance about a prompt that you can use with AI systems to get help on these.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get help or give help to anyone else, please find a similar problem to discuss.  Do not directly work on a problem in the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "These problems are **not** ordered by difficulty.  They are ordered roughly with where the corresponding material appears in the text.  I have a reputation for setting long assignments (I get excited by what each problem can reveal to students).  I will have consultation hours next week (and I will make sure that you can reach me on zoom if you are remote).  As I see where people struggle, I may add hints to these questions.\n",

    "## Instructions for AI use:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain.* \n",

    "AI can be an amazing learning tool.  It is also amazingly effective at preventing learning.  There is a lot of benefit in looking at a problem on your own, thinking about how to solve it, and even running into dead-ends when you attempt the wrong method.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the guidelines for use of AI on this problem set:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Before turning to AI for assistance on a question, think about the question yourself.  Identify what the question is asking and make some attempt to solve it on your own.\n",
    "2. If you use an AI, you must save the \"conversation\" you have.\n",
    "3. You must start the conversation with the prompt below, and you cannot encourage the AI to violate the prompt.\n",
    "4. You must complete the \"Learning Reflection\" below for each question on which you used AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AI Prompt\n",
    "*I am working on a problem that I must solve on my own. Please do not give me the full solution. Instead:* \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Find a similar problem to solve.*\n",
    "- *Ask me questions to check whether I understand each step.*\n",
    "- *Only reveal the next step after I attempt it.* \n",
    "- *If I make a mistake, respond with hints instead of the correct answer.* \n",
    "\n",
    "*My goal is to understand and be able to solve similar problems without AI.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "- What did I already know about this problem before asking AI?\n",
    "- What did I learn?\n",
    "- What detail or technique was the most important for completing this problem?\n",

    "1. Let $X$ be a discrete random variable with distribution\n",

    "   P(X=0) = 0.2, \\quad P(X=1) = 0.5, \\quad P(X=2) = 0.3.\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(a)** Find the probability generating function $\\psi(x)$ of this distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(b)** Use the probability generating function to compute the expected value $\\mathbb{E}[X]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Suppose a generating function is defined as  \n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   f(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} c_n x^n,\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   and you are given that  \n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   f(x) = e^x = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n!}.\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(a)** According to the generating-function paradigm, what sequence $(c_n)$ does the function $f(x)$ represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(b)** Explain how the generating-function paradigm interprets $f(x)$ as a compact way of encoding this sequence. In your explanation, describe how the coefficients $c_n$ can be recovered from the function using derivatives evaluated at $x = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Let $X$ be a discrete random variable with values $\\{0,1,2,\\ldots\\}$ and \n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   P(X = k) = C \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k \\quad \\text{for } k = 0,1,2,\\ldots\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   where $C$ is a normalizing constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(a)** Determine the value of $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(b)** Find the probability generating function $\\mu(x)$ in closed form.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(c)** Use $\\mu(x)$ and $x \\partial_x$ to find $\\sum_k k^2/2^k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In high school I came across a method that seemed to find all of the numbers that are both triangular numbers $(m)(m+1)/2$ and square numbers $n^2$ (I couldn't prove it at the time).  \n",
    "\n",
    "   Consider the sequence $a_n$ defined by $a_0=1$, $a_1=2$ and $a_{n+2} = a_n + 2a_{n+1}$ and the sequence $b_n$ defined by $b_0=1$, $b_1 = 3$ and $b_{n+2} = b_n + 2b_{n+1}$.  Then $(a_nb_n)^2$ is both triangular and square.\n",
    "\n",
    "   I've since learned that this property of the sequence is known, but it's still an interesting result.  We can use OGFs to prove that these are both triangular and square (though it doesn't prove that every triangular and square number is in the sequence).  Some of these steps follow our derivation of the formula for the Fibonacci numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **(a)** For $n=0, 1, 2$ use direct calculate to verify $b_n^2 + (-1)^n = 2a_n^2$.  Thus it follows that $(a_nb_n)^2 = b_n^2(b_n^2\\pm 1)/2$ is both square and triangular.  Now we want to show this for the general case, and be able to quickly find the $n$-th such number.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(b)** Derive the OGFs $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ for both $a_n$ and $b_n$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   **(c)** Let $Q= 1+\\sqrt{2}$ and $R = 1-\\sqrt{2}$.  Your denominators for the OGFs should equal $(1-Qx)(1-Rx)$.  Write $f(x) = A/(1-Qx) + B/(1-Rx)$.  Find $A$ and $B$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **(d)** Use this to write $a_n$ in terms of $Q$ and $R$. Similar steps show that $b_n = (Q^{n+1} + R^{n+1})/2$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **(e)** Write $b_n^2$ in terms of $Q$ and $R$, simplifying any $QR$ term using $QR=-1$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **(f)** Similarly simplify $2a_n^2$ in terms of $Q$ and $R$, and show that $2a_n^2  = b_n^2 + (-1)^n$.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   **(g)** Thus explain why $b_n^2 a_n^2$ is a triangular number (it is clearly square).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. \n",
    "   **(a)** Show how the variance of a distribution can be written using derivatives of a PGF evaluated at $1$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **(b)** Show that the variance equals the mean, iff $\\mu''(1)/\\mu'(1) = \\mu'(1)$.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   **(c)** Use PGFs to show that the variance of the Poisson distribution equals its mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Suppose \n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   f(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty f_n x^n\n",
    "   \\quad\\text{and}\\quad\n",
    "   g(x)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty g_n x^n\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   are ordinary generating functions for sequences $(f_n)$ and $(g_n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(a)** If $\\alpha,\\beta\\in\\mathbb{R}$, write down the generating function corresponding to the sequence $(\\alpha f_n+\\beta g_n)_{n\\ge 0}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(b)** Explain why this shows that the set of all generating functions is closed under linear combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Consider a pair of standard tetrahedral (4-sided) dice numbered $1, 2, 3, 4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(a)** Find the PGF of the sum found by rolling both.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **(b)** Find another pair of 4-sided dice that have positive integer values and give the same sums with the same probabilities.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **(c)** Show that the only possible pairs are the standard dice and the pair you have just found.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. A researcher is looking for patients with a particular rare disease.  Based on careful experiments and knowledge of exposure risk in the populations, she expects the PGF for the number of patients in several similarly sized populations should be $\\mu(x) = e^{5(x-1)}$.  However, when she looks at medical records, she sees that the number seems to have PGF $e^{1.5(x-1)}$.  Using the fact that $\\mu(0.7+0.3x) = e^{1.5(x-1)}$ and many individuals in the population have limited access to medical care, explain what may have happened [hint, what does the PGF $0.7+0.3x$ represent?]\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Consider a Galton–Watson process with $X_0=1$ and offspring distribution given by $\\Pr(k=3)=1$ (every individual has exactly 3 offspring).\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(a)** Draw the Galton–Watson tree up to (and including) generation $2$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **(b)** What are the values of $X_0$, $X_1$, and $X_2$?\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **(c)** Give a formula for $X_g$ for general $g \\geq 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Consider a Galton-Watson process with offspring distribution having PGF $\\mu(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **(a)** Explain why the extinction probability $\\alpha$ of a Galton-Watson process must equal $\\mu(\\alpha)$.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "    **(b)** We always have $1 = \\mu(1)$.  Why does this not guarantee us that all Galton-Watson processes go extinct?\n",
    "   \n",
    "    **(c)** Assume that $3$ individuals of a  plant species are introduced into 3 locations in Victoria.  Find the extinction probability in terms of $\\alpha$ calculated for a single introduction.\n",

    "   \n",
    "    **(a)** Show that for all of these values it goes extinct with probability $1$. \n",
    "   \n",
    "    **(b)** Plot $1-\\alpha_g$ for $g = 1, \\ldots, 100$ for these values of $r$ with a logarithmic vertical scale.  What unusual behavior do you see (if any)?\n",

    "   and the methods it relies on to perform the integral above.  Note that the code in place uses the Fast Fourier Transform by default, but I do not believe this will work for a radius of $1/2$.  So instead you will need to set it up to perform the integral.  Ideally use Python or R.\n",
