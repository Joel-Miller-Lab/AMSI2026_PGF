    "This will be **due Saturday 31 Jan, 11:59PM**.  I'll set up a submission portal on Moodle.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get help or give help to anyone else, please find a similar problem to discuss.  Do not directly work on a problem in the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "These problems are **not** ordered by difficulty.  They are ordered roughly with where the corresponding material appears in the text.  I have a reputation for setting long assignments (I get excited by what each problem can reveal to students).  I will have consultation hours (and I will make sure that you can reach me on zoom if you are remote).  As I see where people struggle, I may add hints to these questions.\n",

    "AI can be an amazing learning tool.  It is also amazingly effective at preventing learning.  There is a lot of benefit in looking at a problem on your own, thinking about how to solve it, and even running into dead-ends when you attempt the wrong method.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the guidelines for use of AI on this problem set:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Before turning to AI for assistance on a question, think about the question yourself.  Identify what the question is asking and make some attempt to solve it on your own.\n",
    "2. If you use an AI, you must save the \"conversation\" you have.\n",
    "3. You must start the conversation with the prompt below, and you cannot encourage the AI to violate the prompt.\n",
    "4. You must complete the \"Learning Reflection\" below for each question on which you used AI.\n",

    "*I am working on a problem that I must solve on my own. Please do not give me the full solution. Instead:* \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Find a similar problem to solve.*\n",
    "- *Ask me questions to check whether I understand each step.*\n",
    "- *Only reveal the next step after I attempt it.* \n",
    "- *If I make a mistake, respond with hints instead of the correct answer.* \n",

    "1. Let us assume we are waiting for some event (*e.g.*, death of a single bacterium or a red light turning green).  We make the assumption that if the event hasn't happened prior to time $t$, then for any fixed $\\Delta t$, the probability that it occurs between $t$ and $t+\\Delta t$ is the same for any $t$.  This means that we assume that the knowledge of how long it has \"survived\" so far does not give us any extra information.  In other words, we are making the assumption that the distribution is *memoryless*\n",

    "\n",

    "7. [optional extension of previous problem - shows some interesting functional analysis properties of $\\Omega(x,t)$]  We write $\\Omega(x,t) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\omega_k(t) x^k$ where $\\omega_k(t)\\geq 0$ is the probability of an outbreak of size $k$ at time $t$ in the infinite population.

    "    The family of functions $\\Omega(x,t)$ for $t=1,2,\\ldots$ is a family of functions that are all continuously differentiable, their limit exists for all $x \\in [0,1]$, but the limit is not even continuous.  The jump is due to probability mass that moves to larger and larger $k$ over time, making $x^k$ go to zero for any $|x|<1$.  Mathematically, $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\Omega(x,t) = \\sum_k \\omega_k(\\infty)x^k$ for $|x|<1$ and $1$ for $x=1$ is not a PGF.  We can patch it up somewhat by introducing $\\omega_\\infty x^\\infty$ where $\\omega_\\infty = 1-\\alpha(\\infty)$ is the probability the outbreak grows to unbounded size and $x^\\infty$ is assumed to be $0$ for $0\\leq x < 1$ and $1$ for $x=1$.\n",

    "   **(c)** Explain why the probability that this transmission attempt results in a new infection depends on the fraction of the population that is susceptible.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(d)** In the early stages of an outbreak in a very large population, a simplifying assumption is often made about the fraction of susceptible individuals. State this assumption and explain why it is reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(e)** The expected size of a Galton-Watson process is given by $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\Phi(1,t)$.  Use this and (one of) the Kolmogorov equations to derive the expected size of the number infected as a function of time (you do not need to derive the Kolmogorov equations).\n",

    "9. Consider the algorithm in the notes for constructing a tree based on a sequence $S$, and the figure which illustrates the algorithm with the sequence $S=(2,2,0,0,0,1,0,3,0)$, for which $j=9$ is the length of the sequence and $j-1=8$ is the sum of the sequence.\n",

By using $\\theta = 2\\pi \\frac{m}{M}$ for $m = 0, 1, \\ldots, M$, (including both end points), adapt methods in `AMSI_2026_PGF_tools` to calculate the probability $\\omega_\\ell(t)$ that exactly $\\ell$ recoveries have occurred for $\\ell = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10$ at times $t = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10$.  Plot $\\omega_\\ell(t)$ using $t$ as the horizontal axis and a logscale vertical axis.\n",
