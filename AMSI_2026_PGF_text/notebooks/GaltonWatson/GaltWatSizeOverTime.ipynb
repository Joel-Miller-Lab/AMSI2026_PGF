    "First we choose $k$ from the distribution of $\\mu_1(x)$.  Then we choose $k$ numbers from the distribution of $\\mu_2(x)$ and add them together.  That is, we are taking a sum of numbers from the distribution of $\\mu_2(x)$ and the number of terms in the sum is taken from the distribution of $\\mu_1(x)$.\n",

So $\\Phi_g(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty q_{g,k}x^k$.  As $q_{0,1}=1$, we know $\\Phi_0(x)=x$ and as $q_{1,k}=p_k$, we know $\\Phi_1(x) = \\mu(x)$.\n",
