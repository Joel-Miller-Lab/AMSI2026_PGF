    "The first 3 questions relate to {ref}`sec:SIRSmallPop`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An SIR outbreak occurs in a small closed population of size $N$. Let $q_\\ell$ denote the probability that exactly $\\ell$ individuals (including the index case) are ever infected.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(a)** In the transmission network interpretation used, individuals are nodes and directed edges represent potential transmission. Explain why the final outbreak size is equal to the size of the out-component of the initially infected individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(b)** For a population of size $N=3$, write down the system of equations that determines $q_1,\\ldots,q_3$ using the Ball-matrix approach. You do not need to solve the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Consider the SIR model with transmission rate $\\beta$ and recovery rate $\\gamma$, for which the offspring PGF is\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\mu(x) = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta + \\gamma - \\beta x}.\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(a)** Compute $\\mu\\left(\\frac{M-1}{N-1}\\right)$ and explain what this quantity represents in the context of small populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(b)** Using the definition of the Ball matrix, write an explicit expression for the coefficients $c_{M,1}$ and $c_{M,2}$ in terms of $\\mu$, $M$, and $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(c)** The matrix defining the system for $q_\\ell$ is lower triangular.  Why does this guarantee that the probabilities $q_1,q_2,\\ldots,q_N$ can be solved sequentially?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The text compares simulated outbreak size distributions with the theoretical probabilities $q_\\ell$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(a)** For a fixed population size $N=50$, describe how you expect the distribution of outbreak sizes to change as $R_0=\\beta/\\gamma$ increases from below 1 to above 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(b)** Explain why, even when $R_0>1$, there is still a substantial probability of small outbreaks in a small population.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(c)** Give one advantage and one limitation of the Ball matrix method for computing outbreak size distributions as $N$ becomes large.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next 2 questions relate to {ref}`sec:HMF`:\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In the heterogeneous mean-field SIR model, individuals are grouped by contact rate $k\\in\\{0,1,2,\\ldots\\}$, and we track $(S_k(t),I_k(t),R_k(t))$ for each $k$. Define\n",

    "   $$\n",
    "   \\pi_I(t)=\\frac{\\sum_{k\\ge 0} k I_k(t)}{N\\psi'(1)}.\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(a)** Explain the *infinite* system of ODEs.  What does each term in the equation represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "   \\begin{align*}\n",
    "   \\frac{d}{dt}S_k &= -\\beta \\pi_I k S_k\\\\\n",
    "   \\frac{d}{dt}I_k &= \\beta \\pi_I k S_k-\\gamma I_k,\\\\\n",
    "   \\frac{d}{dt}R_k &= \\gamma I_k,\n",
    "   \\end{align*}\n",
    "   together with the definition of $\\pi_I(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(b)** Explain why the total *combined* transmission rate in the population is\n",

    "   \\beta\\sum_{\\hat{k}\\ge 0}\\hat{k} I_{\\hat{k}},\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   and why the rate at which individuals in class $S_k$ become infected is\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\beta \\pi_I k S_k.\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(c)** The text describes a “naive approach” that truncates the system by ignoring classes $k>K$ for some cutoff $K$.\n",
    "   Explain why this can be inaccurate when $\\sum_{k>K} k^2 p_k$ is not small, and give an example (in words) of a degree distribution where large $k$ cannot be neglected.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Using the reductions in the notebook, the dynamics can be written in terms of $(I(t),\\pi_I(t),\\theta(t))$ and $\\psi$.\n",

    "   **(a)** Focus on the $d\\pi_I/dt$ equation.  Assuming that at early time $\\theta(t)$ remains approximately $1$ for a long period, estimate $\\pi_I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(b)** Consider two populations with the same mean contact rate $\\psi'(1)$ but different contact-rate distributions, one narrow and the other heavy-tailed ($p_k$ decays slowly for large $k$).\n",
    "   Qualitatively, how would you expect the *early epidemic growth* (via $\\pi_I$) to differ between them?  \n",
    "   \n",
