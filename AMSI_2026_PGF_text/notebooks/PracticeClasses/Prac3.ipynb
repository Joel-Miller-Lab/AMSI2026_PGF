    "1. Consider a continuous-time Galton-Watson process with $X(t)$ individuals at time $t$.  We know that each individual dies (through a Poisson process) with rate $r$ and is replaced by $k$ individuals with probability $p_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Explain why this is equivalent to assuming that there is a Poisson process with rate $rX(t)$ in which a randomly-selected individual is removed and replaced by $k$ individuals with probability $p_k$.  This is the observation that underlies the Gillespie algorithm.\n",

    "   **(a)** Suppose the number of infected/recovered individuals at time $t$ is small compared to the total population size $N$. Explain why the probability that a given transmission event leads to a **new infection** can be approximated as $1$. Using this, justify why $S(t)/N\\approx 1$ during the early stages of an outbreak.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **(b)** Using your reasoning from part (a), argue why the **early spread** of infection can be approximated by a *Galton-Watson process*. In particular, identify what the “offspring distribution” represents in this epidemic context, and write down its **probability generating function (PGF)** in terms of $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$.\n",

By looking at the $(3,0)$ pair and your answer to (4), perform the inductive step of the proof.  That is, consider the sequence after adding the edge for the $(3,0)$ pair.  Match this with your answer to (1) and then update your tree to include this edge.  Verify that the Łukasiewicz word is a cyclic permutation of $S$.\n",

Using just this first step and your tree for (4), do the inductive step of the second proof to create the tree.    Verify that the Łukasiewicz word is a cyclic permutation of $S$.\n",
