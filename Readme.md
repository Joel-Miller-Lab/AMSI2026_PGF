# Probability Generating Functions and Biological Applications

## Overview

These notes are written for the 2026 Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute (AMSI) summer school held at Monash University Jan 2026.

Their purpose is to introduce students to 
- probability generating functions (PGFs)
- manipulations of PGFs and their interpretation
- basic concepts of birth death processes, primarily related to invasive biological systems (infectious disease, invasive species, cancer, within-host pathogens)
- Applications of PGFs to the study of birth-death processes

Currently, these notes consist of one chapter on "Galton-Watson" processes and one chapter on properties of PGFs.  To read it, you will need to alternate between the two chapters.

I will add more chapters with other biological applications.  I may yet reorder the sections so that the mathematics and the applications alternate, rather than keeping them separate but forcing the reader to alternate between chapters.
